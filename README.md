# Trello Board Clone App

A Trello board is a series of lists, with a bunch of cards attached. Click cards to drag and drop them from one list to another. It's a simple, visual way to see what needs to get done. Trello is unique because its layout is the most flexible, open-ended way for you to organize any task
